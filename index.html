      <h1>Why I want to be a web developer:</h1>
      <p>I've long searched for a creative outlet in which I can take what's in my head and put it out there for others to see and experience. I found exactly what I was looking for when I was on my way to a concert and my friend was driving. Before we started our journey, he put his laptop in my lap and said, "Here, you're going to code for me while I drive." It was in this moment I really fell in love with coding.</p>
